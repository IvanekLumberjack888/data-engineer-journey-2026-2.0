MULTIPLE CHOICE

Your company processes real-time stock price data: 100K events/second, <1 sec latency requirement. Which architecture balances latency, cost, complexity?
	
	Eventstream + Eventhouse: sub-100ms latency, highest cost

	Eventstream → KQL → Real-Time Dashboard: <1 sec latency, moderate cost

	Batch pipeline every 1 minute: unacceptable for stock prices
