Case Study 1: Data Pipeline Failure Investigation

Your organization uses Microsoft Fabric for data engineering tasks. Recently, there have been issues with data pipeline runs failing intermittently, causing delays in data processing. The failures occur randomly, and the team needs to identify the root cause quickly.

**Question:** You need to monitor data pipeline runs to identify the root cause of failures. What should you do?

Extend timeout settings for pipelines.

Retry failed runs without investigation.

Use a third-party tool to monitor pipeline runs.

✅ Use the Monitoring hub to analyze pipeline run details.

#### ✅ CORRECT!

**Explanation:** The Monitoring Hub in Fabric provides comprehensive visibility into pipeline execution, including detailed logs, error messages, and activity-level diagnostics. This is the native tool designed for investigating pipeline failures.

✓ MULTIPLE CHOICE

Your company is using Microsoft Fabric to manage data pipelines for a lakehouse solution. Recently, a pipeline failed due to a script activity error. You need to ensure that the pipeline execution fails with a customized error message and code. Which two actions should you perform?

✅ Add a Fail activity.

✅ Configure custom error settings in the Fail activity.

Enable logging for pipeline activities.

Use a Try-Catch activity.

#### ✅ CORRECT!

**Explanation:** To ensure that a pipeline reports a custom error message and code when a script activity fails, you must add a Fail activity and configure its settings with the desired error message and code. The Fail activity is specifically designed for this purpose.

Case Study 2: Real-Time IoT Data Ingestion

Your company processes IoT sensor data in real-time. Currently, data arrives at 10,000 events per second from IoT devices. You need to ingest this data into Fabric with minimal latency (<1 second end-to-end) and ensure data persistence for historical analysis.

**Question:** Which two components should you use to achieve both real-time ingestion and persistence?

✅ Eventstream to ingest events, then Spark Structured Streaming for transformation

✅ Eventstream configured with a Lakehouse destination

Spark Structured Streaming directly from Event Hubs with checkpointing

Dataflow Gen2 for ingestion and Warehouse for storage

#### ✅ CORRECT!

**Explanation:** For real-time IoT ingestion at 10K events/sec, Eventstream is ideal for initial ingestion and routing. To achieve sub-1-second latency with persistence, you can either use Eventstream directly to Lakehouse or pair Eventstream with Spark Structured Streaming.

Q4/55

4/55

◯ SINGLE CHOICE

You have implemented a Spark Structured Streaming job that processes customer transaction data. The job has crashed after processing 10 million events. The checkpoint location is configured. When you restart the job, from which offset should it resume?

Offset 0 - restart from the beginning

✅ The last checkpointed offset - resume without reprocessing

Offset at 10 million - start from where it crashed

Cannot determine - manual recovery required

#### ✅ CORRECT!

**Explanation:** Spark Structured Streaming uses checkpoints to track the exact offset/position of processed data. When a job restarts, it automatically resumes from the last checkpointed offset, eliminating duplicate processing.

Case Study 3: Customer Dimension Management

Your organization maintains customer master data in a Data Warehouse. Customer attributes like address, email, and phone number change frequently. You need to maintain a complete history of all customer changes for audit purposes using SCD Type 2.

**Question:** When implementing SCD Type 2 for the customer dimension, after a customer's address changes and you execute a MERGE statement, how many rows should exist for that customer in the dimension table?

1 - the new address replaces the old

✅ 2 - the old record is marked inactive, a new record is added

0 - old records are deleted

Depends on the MERGE logic

#### ✅ CORRECT!

**Explanation:** SCD Type 2 maintains complete history by adding new rows and marking old rows as inactive (is_active = 0). You'll find both the old inactive record and the new active record.

Case Study 4: Medallion Architecture for E-Commerce

Your e-commerce company is building a data lake using Fabric Lakehouse with a medallion architecture. Raw order data arrives daily (~50GB) with duplicates and quality issues. The silver layer should contain cleaned, deduplicated data.

**Question:** What is the primary responsibility of the Silver layer in your medallion architecture?

Store raw, unprocessed data

✅ Perform data quality checks, deduplication, and business rule application

Serve aggregated data for BI dashboards

Archive historical data

#### ✅ CORRECT!

**Explanation:** The Silver layer is the 'cleansed' layer where data quality rules are applied, duplicates are removed, schema is enforced, and business transformations begin. Bronze is raw, Gold is aggregated.

Q8/55

7/55

◯ SINGLE CHOICE

Your Lakehouse bronze layer contains 50GB of daily raw data. Silver layer performs deduplication and type casting. How frequently should Silver layer tables refresh?

After every bronze file lands (near real-time, every 15 minutes)

✅ Once daily after all bronze loads complete

On-demand by analysts using notebooks

Every 6 hours regardless of updates

#### ✅ CORRECT!

**Explanation:** Once daily after all bronze loads complete is optimal because all source data is present before transformation, enabling efficient batch processing and predictable SLAs.

Case Study 5: Large-Scale Sales Data Optimization

You manage a 100-million row sales fact table in a Lakehouse. Common queries filter by product category (1000 unique values), region (50 values), and date (2-year lookback). Query performance is slow (30+ seconds). The table is currently not partitioned.

**Question:** What partitioning strategy would BEST optimize queries on this 100M-row table?

Partition on category (each category gets its own partition folder)

✅ Partition on date (year/month level) with Z-order clustering on category+region

Partition on region, then Z-order on date+category

No partitioning - instead create 3 separate tables per category

#### ✅ CORRECT!

**Explanation:** Partition on date (month level = ~24 partitions) with Z-order on high-cardinality columns balances reasonable partition count, partition pruning for date-range queries, and multi-column performance.

Q10/55

9/55

◯ SINGLE CHOICE

You're optimizing a slow Lakehouse query on a 500GB fact table. Query profiling shows: 30% I/O, 40% shuffle, 30% compute. Which optimization provides the BIGGEST win?

Reduce I/O by reading fewer columns

Reduce shuffle by optimizing join order and broadcast joins

Increase compute by scaling to larger Spark pool

Cache frequently-accessed DataFrames

#### ✅ CORRECT!

**Explanation:** Shuffle is 40% of runtime - optimizing joins can cut this by 50%+, providing the highest ROI. Target the largest bottleneck first.
