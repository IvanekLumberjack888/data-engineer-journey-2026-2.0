# EXAMPLE CASE STUDY PREP:

# 🚀 CASE STUDY #4: "LogisticsPro" – Real-Time Streaming & Monitoring

Now switching to **real-time architecture and monitoring** — critical for DP-700.

---

## 📖 Scenario

**LogisticsPro** is a logistics company tracking shipments in real-time:

|Data Source|Type|Volume|Latency Requirement|
|---|---|---|---|
|**GPS Trackers**|Event Hub stream|50K events/sec|<5 seconds|
|**Delivery Status Updates**|Event Hub messages|100K/day|<1 minute|
|**Vehicle Diagnostics**|IoT Hub streaming|Continuous|Real-time alerts|
|**Customer Orders**|SQL Database|Batch daily|Hourly refresh|
|**Historical Shipments**|Parquet files in ADLS|1 year archive|Batch queries|

**Challenges:**

- Need real-time dashboards for dispatchers (vehicle locations, alerts)
    
- Detect anomalies (vehicle stops, delays, theft risk) instantly
    
- Archive historical data for compliance
    
- Monitor pipeline health and alert on failures

## 🧠 Question 1

GPS trackers and vehicle diagnostics stream continuously to Event Hub.  
Which **combination** ingests this into Fabric with **lowest latency**?

**A.** Dataflow Gen2 → Lakehouse  
**B.** Eventstream → Eventhouse (KQL DB)  
**C.** Spark Structured Streaming → Warehouse  
**D.** Data Pipeline (Copy activity) → Lakehouse

---

## 🧠 Question 2

Real-time dashboards need to show **vehicle locations and alerts** updated every 5-10 seconds.  
Which Fabric visualization tool is best?

**A.** Power BI Report (refresh every 5 sec)  
**B.** Semantic model with direct query  
**C.** Real-time Dashboard (KQL-backed)  
**D.** Power BI Paginated Report

---

## 🧠 Question 3

GPS stream shows sudden vehicle **stop events** that might indicate theft or breakdown.  
Which **Eventstream transformation** detects stops and routes them to an alert queue?

**A.** Filter (condition: speed = 0)  
**B.** Aggregate (count events by vehicle)  
**C.** Group By (window aggregation)  
**D.** Union (combine multiple streams)

---

## 🧠 Question 4

The GPS stream is ingesting **50K events/sec** into Eventhouse.  
Pipeline suddenly starts dropping events (OutgoingMessages < IncomingMessages).  
What is the **most likely cause**?

**A.** Eventstream transformation too complex  
**B.** Eventhouse write throttling (capacity limit)  
**C.** Event Hub producer sending malformed messages  
**D.** Networking latency between Event Hub and Fabric

---

## 🧠 Question 5

Where do you **monitor Eventstream health** — check Data Insights metrics (IncomingMessages, OutgoingMessages, latency)?

**A.** Monitoring Hub  
**B.** Fabric Admin Portal  
**C.** Eventstream's Data Insights tab  
**D.** Capacity Metrics App

---

## 🧠 Question 6

Daily customer orders from SQL Database must be **merged with historical shipments** (Parquet in ADLS) to create a unified analytics model.  
Which approach avoids **data duplication**?

**A.** Copy orders + historical to Lakehouse, then MERGE  
**B.** Use shortcuts: historical shortcut + copy orders into Lakehouse  
**C.** Create Warehouse with views over external data  
**D.** Replicate everything into Eventhouse

---

## 🧠 Question 7

Data Pipeline ingesting orders sometimes fails due to **transient network errors**.  
How do you configure **automatic retry** without manual intervention?

**A.** Add retry logic in the Copy activity  
**B.** Schedule trigger with daily run (manual retry next day)  
**C.** Deployment pipeline with approval step  
**D.** Use Eventstream with buffer mode

---

## 🧠 Question 8

When a pipeline fails, ops team must be **notified immediately** (not check dashboard manually).  
How?

**A.** Configure alert rule in Monitor Hub with email notification  
**B.** Add "Send Email" activity on the On-Fail branch  
**C.** Set up Fabric Activator trigger on semantic model  
**D.** All of the above work

---

## 🧠 Question 9 (Bonus)

LogisticsPro wants to **archive cold data** (shipments older than 6 months) to reduce storage costs while keeping active data fast.  
Which strategy in Lakehouse?

**A.** VACUUM to delete old Delta versions  
**B.** Partition by ship_date, move old partitions to external storage via shortcuts  
**C.** Disable VOrder on old tables  
**D.** Move to Warehouse and delete from Lakehouse
