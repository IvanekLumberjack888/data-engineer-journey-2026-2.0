# Fabric Dojo 2025

This folder contains my personal work, notes, and code produced during the Fabric Dojo program.  
I only share my own implementations and learnings here – no paid course content or proprietary materials are included.

## 🎯 Goal

Use a 3–4 week access to Fabric Dojo to:

- Build one solid end-to-end Microsoft Fabric project
- Deepen understanding of lakehouse, pipelines, warehouse, and real-time components
- Prepare material for a public portfolio (GitHub + LinkedIn)

## 🕒 Duration

- Approx. 3–4 weeks (intensive sprint)
- Start: 1 December 2025
- End: By end of December 2025 (aligned with DP-700 exam target)

## 📅 Structure

Instead of a 10-week program, I compress my work into 3 focused blocks:

- Block 1: Onboarding & Setup (Week 1)
  - Access, environment setup, understanding the main project
  - First small tasks, exploration, notes

- Block 2: Core Implementation (Week 2–3)
  - Main project work: ingestion, transformation, modeling, reporting
  - Frequent iterations and testing

- Block 3: Wrap-up & Portfolio (Week 4)
  - Refactoring, documentation
  - Screenshots, diagrams, final write-up for portfolio

## 📂 Folder Layout

- `WEEK_01/` – First block: onboarding, setup, first tasks
- `WEEK_02_03/` – Core implementation
- `WEEK_04/` – Wrap-up, polish, portfolio assets
- `MY_CODE/` – Reusable scripts, notebooks, and configs
- `MY_NOTES.md` – High-level notes and reflections
- `LEARNINGS.md` – Key takeaways, mistakes, and lessons learned

## ⚖️ Legal & Ethics

- I only publish:
  - My own code
  - My own notes in my own words
  - My own diagrams, reflections, and learnings
- I do not publish:
  - Course videos, PDFs, or raw assignments
  - Screenshots of paid materials
  - Direct copy of any protected content

This keeps me aligned with Skool / Fabric Dojo Terms of Service.
